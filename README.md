# 🐘 Easy Discord Widget (PHP)


I got bored and decided to make this, anyways this is mainly for beginners that wanna easily echo discord json stuff to their website.
This will require you to have your widget enabled (it takes a while for the wiget to update the json if you just enabled it)

Refer to the example: https://github.com/Lunaversitay/ez-discordwidget/blob/master/example.php for assistance.
